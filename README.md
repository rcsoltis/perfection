# Portfolio Perfection Theme
A custom WordPress theme created from a static Bootstrap site.

1.	The goal was to create a unique, custom WordPress theme from a Bootstrap static framework with the following basic requirements:<br>
  •	content that is fully user-editable<br>
  •	style that provides users with some control and ability to edit<br> 
  •	has posts, pages, 404, search, comments, and custom templates<br>
  •	sidebars (widget areas)<br>
  •	uses PHP conditions and other statements<br>
  •	is translation-ready<br>
  •	content that will be replaced with plugins and widgets.

2.	The project met the goal, except for some minor styling issues.

3.	The project started with a unique static site designed using Bootstrap, which was then converted to a WordPress theme. This approach
was chosen to focus effort on the innerworkings and file structures of WordPress by providing initial CSS for the theme via Bootstrap.
Each file listed in the perfection folder is used to create the specific pages and style to the theme. Users must install WordPress, the
Perfection theme files, and activate the theme.

4.	This was a solo project that I received feedback on via a mentor (a professor). In order to fix the navbar menu in mobile view, I need
to check for: Bootstrap errors, enqueue issues with navwalker, or a class typo. 

5.	I would like to spend more time tweaking the current style and resolving the navigation in mobile view, as it worked in the Bootstrap
template site. In addition, I want to update the overall styling of the page to look more modern and up-to-date. This was an enjoyable
process that I desire to do again.

6.	To use this theme:<br>
  •	Download and install WordPress on your remote or local host.<br>
  •	Click on the ‘Clone or download’ button and then on ‘Download zip.’<br>
  •	Once the zipped file is saved, upload it into your WordPress ‘themes’ folder.<br>
  •	Activate the theme from your WordPress admin dashboard.<br>
  •	Customize with styling, widgets, and plugins.<br>
